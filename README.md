## Sharing Feedback Effectively
Sharing feedback is critical as a team. Feedback should be given to critique and praise. Either way the "FBI" method provides a helpful framework for crafting your message.

"FBI" stands for __Feeling__, __Behavior__, __Impact__. These three elements are used to communicate clearly and effectively.

### Feeling
Share what the other person made you feel -- Consider using the list of emotions above to augment your choice of language.

### Behavior
Articulate the specific action or situation you are giving feedback about. When communicating the behavior do your best to keep it to the facts, avoiding adding your interpretation of events. By communicating the facts the discussion can rest on the feeling and impact, rather than an argument about what happened.

For example, rather than saying "when you micromanaged my part of the report", say "when you reported on the Accounts Receivable during the meeting."

### Impact
What is the result of the person's behavior?

### Bringing it together
Feeling | Behavior | Impact
--- | --- | --- 
I felt overworked | When you asked me to have the project complete by the next morning | Which makes me less content in this job
I felt excited | When you replied in depth to the article I posted | Which makes me feel seen and encouraged to share more
